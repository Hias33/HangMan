You need to implement the Random Word Api to your Java Truststore for it to work.
Maybe a certificate implementation directly in the code could work too but i couldnt figure it out yet.
Cmd command for the implementation:

keytool -import -alias heroku-api-cert -file C:\path\to\certificate.crt -keystore C:\path\to\mykeystore.jks -storepass changeit
